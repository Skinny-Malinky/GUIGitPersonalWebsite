        <h3>An' A That</h3>
        <p>"An' A' That" is an app made for a specific poetry community. I address the problem that many people have with Burns' poetry in that they only ever read it in school. I want to introduce a more playful element in the way that people interact with Burns poetry and allow them to explore it without having to worry about academic pressures.</p>
        
        <p>The interaction of tearing up paper is an important part of the experience as it is a cathartic act. Prototyping the "snapping into place" of each of the torn words is important and I would add further animations and sound effects to improve the prototype.</p>
