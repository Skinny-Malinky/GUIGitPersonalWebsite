					Name: Frankie Comrie<br />
					Type of experience: Good<br />
					Place visited: Melbourne, Australia<br /><br />
					
					&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
					We arrived in the morning, walking out into the heavenly warmth of the Australian summer. Ladened with bags, protected by the sunscreen and trickles of water that slides down our bare whoulders. We had finally arrived and already I was looking forward to seeing more of the city. <br/ ><br />
						
					Building homes for habitat during the day, seeing the city by the moon and falling for the city in which I had found myself living these past three months I couldn't have been happier. That is until the moment that we met the people we were building the houses for, a moment I shall never forget..
