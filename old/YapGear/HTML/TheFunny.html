						Right, so we find ourselves stumbling along the Ibiza beach and Josh was busy shoving Lee around. They were just being daft-alcohol hits them real quick-but it was absoloutely hilarious. We were filming their antics and all of a sudden Josh sunk down into some like quick sand, well that was us, we just ccollapsed into a fit of laughter! Safe to say that video found itself onto "You've Been Framed". Classic..
