			<h1> North America </h1><!--continent info page-->
			
			<hr />
			<h2>  Alaska </h2>
			
			<p> Alaska is home to some of the most stunning scenery North America has to offer. Positions in National Parks and places of natural beauty exist across the state. If you are interested in nature, conservation and the great outdoors then this is the destination for you. Volunteering is the best place to start and there are numerous ways to get involved throughout Alaska. The bureau of land management offers 300 volunteer placements annually and the US Forest service has even more. With eight national parks in the state there is plenty of scope for hands on research posts to administrative and educational roles. Most placements offer accommodation and a small stipend.</p>

			<h2>  Canada </h2>
				<p> Canada is the second largest country in the world. There is more than enough to see and do in Canada to justify spending an entire gap year there. Many visitors expect Canada to be a slightly less brash version of the neighbouring USA but, in actual fact, Canada possesses a unique character extremely different from the one to be found south of the border. While Canada has its fair share of lively cosmopolitan cities, Canada's biggest draw is undoubtedly its stunning scenery and wildlife. Canada is blessed with vast areas of unspoilt wildernesses which are home to animals such as wolves, bears and bald eagles. This is greatly helped by the fact that ninety percent of the Canada's 28.5 million population lives within 100 miles of the USA border. Canada is also a particularly beautiful place to ski and many of Canada's ski resorts are hailed as being amongst the finest in the world. Added to all of this is Canada's renowned friendly reputation - making Canada a fantastic country in which to spend your gap year.

			<h2>  Mexico </h2>
				<p> Mexico is a country which has recently undergone a period of rapid economic growth. However, its development is under threat with arid lands expanding under the weight of desertification and fertile plains receding under the strain of irrigation.
If you want to reverse effects of global warming, you can help in a small way by developing our conservation projects in the Chihuahua Desert. Mining and irrigation have left this wetland vastly depleted. You can help preserve this nature reserve by securing dams and replanting local plant speicies.

Alternatively, you could try your hand at conserving local flamingo populations. We have opportunities protecting the nests, feeding sites and making sure fresh water is available for the birds. Other volunteer projects include directing IT classes for Mexican children, teaching English and working at turtle hatcheries.</p>
			<br> 
			
			<h2>  Cuba </h2>
				<p> Volunteering on a gap year in Cuba is very popular, but it can be quite difficult to find volunteer opportunities. If you get in touch with local projects or have specific skills like ESL teaching experience this can help.

Gap year voluntary work opportunities like helping children and Cuban youth at community projects are popular with people on a meaningful gap year in Cuba. If you are an enthusiastic person with a desire to help a local community and the determination to improve your Spanish, volunteering in Cuba could be just what you're looking for.

Gap year work in Cuba is almost impossible to find. But you could learn Spanish at a language school and then look for placements gap year teaching in Cuba. 

After volunteering you could take a gap year tour in Cuba.</p>

			<h2>  U.S.A. </h2>
				<p> The USA is one of those places that's so ingrained in to our culture from all the US films, music and TV we've grown up with that you can get a real sense of deja vu when you're travelling around it - even if you've never been there before.. The USA is such a huge, diverse country that it's impossible to adequately summarise it in one web page.

The USA has so much to offer in terms of work and travel, making it a great place to spend your summer break. If you plan to travel extensively around the USA and supplement your savings through paid work at the same time, our work and travel the USA Summer Student Programme makes it simple for you to gain summer work in the USA. Consider this USA working holiday programme if you're a full-time student and fancy spending your summer holidays in the USA.</p>
