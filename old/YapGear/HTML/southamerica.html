				<h1> South America </h1><!--continent info page-->
				<hr />
				<h2> • Chile </h2>
					<p> Rich in natural mineral wealth, volcanoes and lakes, Chile conjures images of snow caped mountains and ancient Mapuche with age old customs. The country is a maze of rivers, fjords and inlets, perfect terrain for extreme travellers seeking extreme experiences.

					Chile's capital city Santigo combines the colonial with the modern, where a metropolis sits in the snowcapped mountains of the Andes. The city has a distinct metropolitan feel formed from the variety of European, Latin and indigenous influences.

					Take a stroll through the beautiful city squares and gardens, or explore the vast number of theatres, restaurants and art galleys. For volunteers who want to experience South America, without the culture shock, Santigo's European flavour is enough to persuade even the most timid of volunteers. </p>
				<br> 
				
				<h2> • Brazil </h2>
					<p> A gap year in Brazil is a excellent place to experience life in South America on your year out. A gap year travel to Brazil is particularly popular with travellers wanting to explore the Amazon jungle. However, if jungle isn't for you, you could spend your gap year in action-packed Rio de Janeiro – which enjoys a beautiful position between golden beaches and dramatic mountains. If your gap year in Brazil coincides with the Friday before Shrove Tuesday you’ll also be able to party for five days at the world famous Rio carnival!</p>
				<br> 
				
				<h2> • Bolivia </h2>
					<p> You could explore the Amazon jungle in the Parque Nacional Madidi – one of South America’s most intact ecosystems and home to more protected species than any other park in the world. Other gap year highlights of Bolivia include a La Paz (the world’s highest capital city) and the beautiful Lake Titicaca (the world’s highest navigable lake).

					A particularly rewarding Bolivia gap year option is to do some gap year volunteer. Bolivia volunteer work on your gap year enables you to experience local culture more fully whilst at the same time ‘giving something back’ to one of South America’s poorest countries.</p>
				<br> 
				
				<h2> • Peru </h2>
					<p> The highlight for many travellers taking a gap year in Peru is trekking the Inca Trail to the ‘lost city’ of Machu Picchu. There’s so much more to a gap year in Peru than simply Machu Picchu... other Peru gap year highlights include the historic and picturesque city of Cusco, the mysterious lines etched in to the desert at Nazca and beautiful Lake Titicaca (the world’s highest navigable lake).

					A great way to spend your gap year travel in Peru is by taking a Real Gap adventure expedition – which takes in all the essential sights as well as other places much more ‘off the beaten track.’</p>
				<br> 
				
				<h2> • Argentina </h2>
					<p> The high Andes mountain range provides a formidable natural barrier between Argentina and Chile on the west side of Argentina. Along the eastern foot of the Andes are Argentina's parched desert regions. In the south of Argentina is the vast area of Patagonia - boasting an impressive mountainous interior, some of Argentina's most unique coastal wildlife and national parks blessed with some of the most unspoilt and untouched nature on the planet. The most populated region of Argentina is the ‘pampa', an area roughly in the middle of the country covering some 650,000 square kilometres and consisting mainly of vast and rich flat plains.</p>
