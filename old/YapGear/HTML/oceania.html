			<h2>  New Zealand </h2>
			
			<p> Maybe the landscape of Middle Earth, which dazzled in the Lord of the Rings movies, draws people here for some of the most stunning scenery on the planet. Or perhaps it’s the supremely relaxed atmosphere and cheerful, friendly locals that make NZ special. On the other hand, maybe it’s the adrenalin sports and wicked beaches that call so many of us over there. Or possibly it’s the world-class skiing. Or perhaps the totally amazing food and wine. Or the thermal spas, whale watching trips or one of the hundred other things this lucky country has got going for it!

Most likely it’s the mix of all of these things and more that make New Zealand so popular with those on a gap year. Add on top of these the relative safety of travelling in the country, the common language and the ready availability of work to help you pay for your trip and it’s easy to see the appeal of the place. One word of warning though - you might love it so much you decide to stay on for another year. Come to think of it, I know a few people who turned their back on the UK and moved there for good!</p>
			<br> 
			
			<h2>  Australia </h2>
				<p>The main arrival points for your gap year in Australia are the cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane and Cairns. Sydney is Australia's largest city and most people starting their gap year in Australia choose to arrive there. If your gap year in Australia is part of a round the world itinerary it may be that you need to look for work fairly soon after arrival in order to boost your funds. If this is the case then Sydney and Melbourne are probably better places to arrive in to if you're keen to find work soon after starting your gap year in Australia. This isn't to say of course that finding work in places like Brisbane, Cairns and Perth on your gap year in Australia is difficult - just that there are generally more opportunities in Sydney and Melbourne.
				</p>

			<h2>  Tasmania </h2>
				<p> Tasmania is a conservationist’s dream. From collecting jumpers for baby penguins to removing old bangers from bush land, the possibilities are endless. After a hard day cleaning out Devil cages you can relax with a Tasmanian beer and gaze at the landscape the country’s famous for.

Since its colonial days Tasmania has suffered economic peaks and troughs. In the last few years the country has recreated itself as a prime tourist venue. Its oldest buildings have been restored to offer B and B to road-trippers and the capital’s ferry-lines have been revived to ship more and more people back and forth from mainland Australia.</p>
			<br> 
			
			<h2>  Malaysia </h2>
				<p> A gap year in Malaysia is easy to build in to a round the world itinerary – either before or after Thailand. However if you’re not wanting to travel round the world, a Malaysia gap year is well worth considering in its own right.

Malaysia has spectacular beaches!
A Malaysia gap year provides some of the finest beaches in Southeast Asia (including the idyllic Perhentian Islands) as well as loads of interesting places to explore inland. Away from the mainland you could also opt to spend your gap year in Malaysia exploring jungles and rainforest on the island of Borneo – the home of the gravely endangered orang-utan (the only great ape found outside of Africa).</p>
