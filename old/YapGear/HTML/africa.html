			<h1> Africa </h1><!--continent info page-->
			
			<hr />
			<h2> • Nigeria </h2>
			
			<p> Travel to Nigeria and enjoy the beautiful environment, wildlife and the bustling cities.
				A lot of people on a gap year in Nigeria or volunteer in Nigeria. 
				You could teach in Nigeria or take part in year our programs with African NGO's and charitable organisations. 
				Work in Nigeria can include internships, or training to become a game ranger guide. 
				Take a safari or Nigeria tour and get ready for the trip of a lifetime.</p>
			<br> 
			
			<h2> • Togo </h2>
				<p> We are a small NGO based in Lomé, Togo. Our main areas of work are within HIV/AIDS, Social Cases, Street Children, Orphans and Children with HIV/AIDS.
				The charity has a number or places for international volunteers. The costs are very reasonable and the volunteers have the opportunity of a real experience as they will be involved in meetings every morning to discuss the cases as well as assist on visits to patients at their homes or in hospital.
				There are general admin tasks as well as writing up reports of the visits and reading them out in the morning meeting.
				The charity is very flexible and they welcome new ideas from volunteers. There is also no requirements from the volunteers in having previous expereince. They can stay for as little or as long as they like and can be of any age above 16 .
				Togo is a French speaking country and it would be necessary to have the basics of French but it is not essential to be fluent.
				</p>
			<br> 
			
			<h2> • Ghana </h2>
				<p> Ghanaians are renowned as one of the most friendly and welcoming peoples in Africa. 
				The country offers a fascinating mix of experiences from the serenity and colourful clothes of traditional Africa in the rural areas, to the exhilarating beat of nightlife buzzing in the capital Accra. 
				This, combined with political stability, makes Ghana an ideal environment for experiencing a gap year in Africa. 
				For British students, the fact that English is the national language is an added bonus.</p>
			<br> 
			
			<h2> • Sudan </h2>
				<p> Independent travellers in Sudan (definitely those with their own vehicles and possibly those using public transport) require a Permit To Travel if going to any places the Government deems unstable. Obtaining one is an arduous ordeal, costing US$15 and taking around a day (in Wadi Halfa). 
				Travel permits are not required for the Northern State, nor on the road to Ethiopia. They are required if going near Eriteria, toward Darfur or southern Kordofan. 
				The recent attack on Omdurman (May 2008) has increased security and hence this information may be out of date.</p>
			<br>
			
			<h2> • Zambia </h2>
				<p> The African country of Zambia is often ignored by travellers visiting Victoria Falls who, instead, generally choose to spend their time on the other side of the Zambezi River in neighbouring Zimbabwe. Travellers who don't go over the border in to Zambia are, however, really missing out. Aside from being an excellent alternative base for visiting the Victoria Falls and the Zambezi River, Zambia is a beautiful country in its own right and is home to some superb national parks teeming with a wide variety of African wildlife. The people of Zambia are also extremely welcoming and friendly and, if you are looking to visit somewhere a little more off the beaten track during your gap year in Africa, then Zambia is an excellent option.</p>
