			<h2>  China </h2>
			
			<p> China is an ideal and challenging gap year destination for the more adventurous gap year traveller looking to experience something different. For many years communist China was a no-go area for western travellers. In recent years, however, China has opened up to a far greater extent and it's now possible to explore this vast, fascinating country on your gap year travel. China is such an enormous country; the best way to travel around China is to decide on the places you definitely don't want to miss and focus on these. There are plenty of highlights to focus on as well, including the only man-made construction that can be seen from outer space - The Great Wall of China. It's even now possible for gap year travellers to work in China if they want to, giving them a far greater understanding of a culture completely alien to anyone who's grown up in the free-market western world.     </p>

			<h2>  India </h2>
				<p> You could spend your gap year in India enjoying some of its ‘picture postcard’ tropical beaches. For the more energetic, the adventures are end opportunity to trek in the Himalaya Mountains, explore deserts and discover its beautiful flora and fauna. One of the most rewarding type of India gap year projects is to volunteer. A great way to experience local culture is to become a Real Gap India volunteer, meet locals on a more intimate level whilst making a positive contribution at the same time.

A gap year in India is also about experiencing one of the world’s most fascinating and complex cultures and there are numerous ‘must see’ places of interest on an India gap year.

			<h2>  Russia </h2>
				<p> Russia now celebrates a nation of vast diversity and vibrance, after years of communism.

There is so much to enjoy from a gap year in Russia and understandably so much to see and do in a country that spans eleven time zones and two continents, its furthest eastern border ending less than 50 miles from North America.

St. Petersburg served as Russia's capital city for more than 200 years, and despite heavy collateral damage suffered during both the Revolution and World War II, the city continues to be a source of pride for the Russian people, a symbol of the greatness that was Czarist Russia.

We offer 4 different Russia volunteer programmes in St. Petersburg - your choice of placement is based upon your interests and skills.</p>
			<br> 
			
			<h2>  Japan </h2>
				<p> One of the most common jobs in Japan is to teach English and there are numerous openings available in this field. However if teaching English isn't something that especially appeals to you there are many other types of jobs in Japan you can apply for. Some of the jobs in Japan gap year travellers on the Real Gap programme have found in the past include jobs as diverse as acting, web design and research. There are jobs in Japan available throughout the country, not just the larger cities such as Tokyo. If you would like to apply for jobs in Japan more off the beaten track there are support offices for the programme based in eleven different Japanese locations - meaning you will receive as much local back-up and help in these places as you would anywhere else.</p>
			<br>
			
			<h2>  Bangladesh </h2>
				<p> It’s the home of curry as we know it. But once you’ve feasted on vindaloo and aloo saag, what more is there to do in Bangladesh? Help at eye clinics, track the elusive Bengal Tiger, or teach English in rural schools. And finish up with a week on the world’s longest beach.

Sound tempting? Pack your suitcase, leave civilisation behind you, and spend your GAP year in the world’s happiest nation. According to the London School of Economics, despite being one of the poorest places in the world is also one of the happiest.</p>
