        <p>WRASAC offers a quality support service for women, young women and girls in the Dundee and Angus area who have been raped or sexually abused at anytime in their lives.</p>
        <h3>Brief History</h3>
        <p>The Women's Rape and Sexual Abuse Centre (WRASAC) offers free and confidential support for women, young women and girls who have been raped or sexually abused at anytime in their lives.</p>
        <p>Prior to July 1999 the organisation was known as Dundee Rape Crisis Centre and obtained charitable status in 1984. The centre was initially established to provide support to women who had experienced rape or sexual assault.</p>
        <p>The reality, however, is that the majority of women utilising WRASAC services are adult survivors of child sexual abuse, only a very small percentage of women call for help immediately after being raped, sexually abused or sexually assaulted.</p>
        <p>It is more likely that women seek support months or even years after the abuse due to the effect and stigma suffered when trying to disclose abuse. In reponse to this, the results of a community survey and service users comments ('can you help me, I was sexually abused as a child?') we decided to change the Centre's name to Women's Rape and Sexual Abue Centre in 1999.</p>
